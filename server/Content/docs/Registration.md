User registration is required to ensure that only authorized individuals can update packages that they create, mitigate spam, and to allow for the Napack Framework administrators to contact Napack owners.

User registration requires only an email, which will be used pursuant to the Napack Framework Server [Privacy Policy](http://napack.net/Content/PrivacyPolicy.txt). Generating a user will create a series of IDs that will authenticate you with the Napack Framework Server. The Napack Framework Server is designed so that the Napack Framework Server Administrator has no access to your IDs -- if you forget these IDs and need a new series of IDs generated, you will need to contact the Napack Framework Server administrator for assistance.
