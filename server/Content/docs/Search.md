The [Napack Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GuMiner.NapackExtension) supports searching for Napacks
and integrating them directly into your projects that use the [](Napack Client NuGet Package).

Within the Napack Framework Server Website

You can also visit [Napack](http://napack.net/Search) and directly search for a Napack to use.
See the [Consumption](./Consumption.md) page for detailed instructions to manually add the Napack to your project.
