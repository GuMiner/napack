###How Napack Licensing Works
--------------------------
By default, Napack will create a **Napack.attributions** file for each consumed Napack in your code. Users can then append the **Napack.attributions** file to the end of their license file to correctly attribute Napacks.

Unfortuantely, this ideal scenario only works if Napacks are created using permissive open-source licenses. These licences ("free as in free") -- unlike copy-left licences ("free as in (*something limiting freedom*)") or commercial licences ("not free") -- allow for the end user to create and use Napacks *directly* in their source code without compromizing the commercial viability or true freedom of their code.

In the spirit of promoting interoperability and freedom *of Napacks*, the default Napack settings will not permit consumption of copy-left, commercial, or custom licenses. However, in the spirit of promoting *freedom*, these settings can be changed by the end user at their own risk and discretion.
